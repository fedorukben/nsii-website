        <p class="text-wrap">Sensory processing disorder (SPD) is prevalent amongst a sizeable proportion of the population, afflicting at least 1 in 20 adults. Cases of individuals having SPD appear to be trending upward amongst school-aged children, with 5-16% of these children being affected - many of whom have other cognitive impairments (e.g., ASD and ADHD). These travellers have difficulty navigating airports, which can be attributed in part to audio stimuli. Sensory rooms currently in use provide a space for those experiencing a breakdown to remove themselves from stimulating situations, but are not proactive in the prevention of breakdowns. The SenseHB Network proposes a method which would pipe audio into noise cancelling headphones. This technology allows people who suffer from SPD to block out external audio stimuli while allowing them to be aware of important airport announcements, such as flight information. The SenseHB Network utilizes BLE to allow for zoned announcements and stronger signal connection. The hardware required to implement this technology is also currently widely available in most airports. The SenseHB Network provides an original, user-centric, executable, and usable solution to benefit travellers who suffer with SPD.</p>
        <p class="text-wrap">You may be interested in learning the intriguing etymology of the SenseHB Network, specifically the term "SenseHB", as well as the symbolism behind the logo. The Bluetooth symbol is an overlay of the glpyhs for the Norse equivalent of "H" and "B". These letters denote Harald "Bluetooth" Gormsson, the King of Denmark in the late 10th century. Harald unified much of Denmark, increasing communication across the Danish states. Similarly, the Bluetooth technology increases communication. The logo separates the two Norse glyphs for "H" and "B".</p>
