        <p class="center text-center text-wrap" style="width: 55rem;">Kai is entering his first year in Mechanical Engineering Technician studies at Confederation College. While indeed entering a field focused on the more mechanical aspects of building and design, Kai has also always been interested in and explored computer science and programming, dating all the way back to when he was in middle school. Kai is very much something driven by the desire to find innovative solutions to the world's problems and aspires to have a career developing the cutting edge technologies related to robotics - particularly focused on making Northern Canada more habitable. Kai is someone whose interests are so broad that most of the time it can be quite a detriment as he is pulled in too many directions. However, he would say that his core passions lie in table-top roleplaying, engaging in geek culture, reading, drawing, practicing french and striving to become a better person.</p>
